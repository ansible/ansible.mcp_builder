# Default variables for github_mcp role
# Users can override these in their playbooks or group_vars

# GitHub MCP Server Mode: 'local' or 'remote'
# - local: Build and run the server locally (requires Go build)
# - remote: Use GitHub's hosted MCP service (no build required)
github_mcp_mode: "local"

# Note: github_mcp_registry is defined in vars/main.yml (local mode, default).
# When github_mcp_mode='remote', tasks/main.yml loads vars/remote.yml to override it.
# Registry discovery is now role-specific (uses role_name), preventing variable pollution.
